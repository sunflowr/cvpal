CVpal, a cheap and cheerful USB to CV/Gate interface.

Original developer: Olivier Gillet (ol.gillet@gmail.com)

The firmware is released under a GPL3.0 license. It uses Objective Development's
V-USB virtual USB library.

The PCB layouts and schematics (in cvpal/hardware_design/pcb)
are released under a Creative Commons cc-by-sa 3.0 license.

------

A extended version of CVpal, now with 4 CV out and 8 gates/triggers.
No real schematic for it, only a breadboard layout - sorry.

Hacked together by Johan Anderson (https://github.com/sunflowr/)

Part of the functionality is still the same (such as calibration).

Modes:
CH1 - Mono mode.
---
CV1       Note
CV2       Velocity
CV3       CC0
CV4       CC1
G1/2/3/4  Gate
G5        24 PPQ
G6        8 PPQ
G7        4 PPQ
G8        Start trigger

CH2/3/4/5 - Quad mono mode.
---
CV1       Note CH2
CV2       Note CH3
CV3       Note CH4
CV4       Note CH5
G1        Gate CH2
G2        Gate CH3
G3        Gate CH4
G4        Gate CH5
G5        24 PPQ
G6        8 PPQ
G7        4 PPQ
G8        Start trigger

CH6 - Quadrophonic mode.
---
Like the old Duophonic mode except support for four voices instead of two:

This mode is enabled when a MIDI message is received on channel 6. The CVpal behaves like a quadrophonic CV-Gate converter with voice stealing.

CV1       Note CV output 1
CV2       Note CV output 2
CV3       Note CV output 3
CV4       Note CV output 4
G1        Gate
G2        Gate
G3        Gate
G4        Gate
G5        24 PPQ
G6        8 PPQ
G7        4 PPQ
G8        Start trigger

CH7 - CC conversion
---
(not tested to much.. probably buggy)
To be implemented - currently disabled.

CH8/9 - Note conversion + CC
---
(not tested to much.. probably buggy)
To be documented.

CH10 - Drums with velocity.
---
(not tested to much.. probably buggy)
CV1       Drum 1 velocity.
CV2       Drum 2 velocity.
CV3       Drum 3 velocity.
CV4       Drum 4 velocity.
G1        Drum 1 Gate
G2        Drum 2 Gate
G3        Drum 3 Gate
G4        Drum 4 Gate
G5        24 PPQ
G6        8 PPQ
G7        4 PPQ
G8        Start trigger
To be documented.

CH11 - Drum triggers.
(not tested to much.. probably buggy)
---
G1        Drum 1 trigger
G2        Drum 2 trigger
G3        Drum 3 trigger
G4        Drum 4 trigger
G5        24 PPQ
G6        8 PPQ
G7        4 PPQ
G8        Start trigger

CH12 - Drum gates.
---
Same as CH11, but with gates instead of triggers.

CH13/14/15/16
---
Calibration.
See http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/cvpal/manual

OUT 1 is calibrated by sending note messages to channel 13.
OUT 2 is calibrated by sending note messages to channel 14.
OUT 3 is calibrated by sending note messages to channel 15.
OUT 4 is calibrated by sending note messages to channel 16.


[ Rest of modes to be documented soon :) ]
